# CS511-CarPlate
CS2511 Chapter 11 Individual Lab Assignment

**Assignment:** Write a class  named CarPlate encapsulating the concept of a license plate, assuming that it has the following attributes: the plate number, the state and its color. 
Write a client program that creates three CarPlate objects, writes them to a file as objects, then reads them from a file as objects, outputs a description of the object using the toString() method (which the CarPlate class should override), and outputs the number of objects. When reading the objects, you should assume that you do not know the number of objects in the file.
